# Portfolio Website

## Description
```
In this project I learned to create the code for a webpage using HTML and CSS. This webpage is a showcase of my ability and knowledge that I have been able to garner in the last 10 days through the bootcamp. It was a challenge to phrase the right questions in order to get the right answers from Google, Xpert Learning as well as Youtube.
